# MicroPython

That project is my learning of MicroPython. The [MicroPython project](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) aims to develop an implementation of Python on microcontrollers.

# Organisation of the repositories
The first repository is the reference to the MicroPython project build and make documentation.
The repositories 2 to 4 follows the tutorial from Invent Box Tutorials on youtube.
And the repositories 5 and more are my interpretation of differents tutorials.

# Hardware
The code is tested on the STM32F4DISCOVERY.It is development kit for the microcontroller STM32F407 from STMicroelectronics.

# License

That project uses the MIT License, like the MicroPython project.
